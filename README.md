# Javascript HTML and CSS project

Simple project created with javascript, html and pure css

This project implements a synchronized checkbox system with both a native and a custom checkbox. The native checkbox is a standard HTML <input> element, while the custom checkbox is a styled button element designed to mimic the behavior of a checkbox. Both checkboxes are fully synchronized: when one is checked, the other reflects the same state, and focus styles are applied consistently to ensure accessibility.

Key features:

Synchronization: Checking or unchecking either checkbox updates the state of the other.
Accessibility: The custom checkbox uses aria-checked and aria-label attributes to ensure it is accessible to screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Focus Management: Focus styles are applied to both checkboxes, ensuring a clear visual indication of focus for users.
Custom Styling: The custom checkbox is styled using CSS to provide a visually distinct appearance while maintaining functionality.
